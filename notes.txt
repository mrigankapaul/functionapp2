Azure Function = Event + Code
    - Run a task in background
    - New Data being available ( In a Queue or Blob Storage)
    - HTTP Request
Azure Functions
    - Simplified Programming model
    - Eliminate bolier plate code - like connecting to a topic of a queue
    - Consumption based pricin model
        - Pay as you go mode
        - Only pay for what you use
        - Automatic scaling
Azure Functions Pricing
     Run in App Service Plan 
        - Existing pricing model
        - Predictive monthly Cost
        - No function duration cost
     Or Consumption plan
        - Limits function execution time to 5 mins
        - Optional Daily max quota
        Billing model 
            - No of executions
            - CPU (Time) * RAM (GB)
        Free Tier
            - 1,000,000 executions
            - 400,000 GBs

    Azure Premium Function Plan
        - Vnet connectivity
        - Improved performance
    Azure Function Runtime is available as Docker Container

    Serverless 
        - Management and maintenance of the service could be delegated to 3rd Party
        - Use Platform as a service (Cosmos DB or Auth0)
    Function as a service (FaaS)
    Function App 
        - Group of related functions (that allow us to share configuration setting and resources)

    Azure Function Use Cases
        - Experiments and prototyping
        - Automating development process
        - Decomposing or extending monolithic applications
        - Independent scaling 
        - Adapaters for integrating systems.
    Trigger Types -
        - Timers, HTTP Requests, Queue Messsages, Blobs, Cosmos DB
    Input and Output Bindings
        - Connect to external resources
        - Reduce amount of code

    You dont have to use bindings
    Bindings are provided for convinience
    
   IBinder - customize any binding at runtime.
    Works with all binding attributes. Calculate attribute parameters on-demand in the function body.
Flexible to choose the type of binding at runtime.

    //// Deploying Azure Functions ///

    Infrastructure
        - App Service Plan
        - Storage Account
        - Application Insights
        - Function App
    Create Infrastructure
        - Azure Portal
        - Visual Studio
    Infrastructure as Code
        - Azure CLI
        - ARM Template

    Publishing your code
        - Visual Studio
        - Portal
    Automated Publsihing
        - Publish zip with kudu
        - "run From package"
        - Git Reporsitory
        - Azure Function core tool
        - az cli
        - Azure Devops pipleline has some built in capabilities to easily publish

    Cold Start
    kusto query language

    Authorization Levels
        - Anonymous, Functions, Admin ( One code for all functions)
    Function Level Authorization
        - Specific code per function
        - "code" query string parameter
        - "x-functions-key" HTTP Header

    Enable "Easy Auth" in Azure App Service Feature - Applies to entire Function App
    Integrates with Azure AD, Google, facebook others
    Redirects you to login page

    Azure API Management - (Use security features of API management)
    Azure Functions can integrate with other services -
        - Azure Function Proxies (Redirect Incoming HTTP Requests) / Redirect to Blob storage with can have the JS files (SPA)
        - Azue API Management Acts as a API Gateway - Routes to backend function API        Can add security (Verify API Keys, JWT Token or certificates)
                                                        Can add caching layer, Usage Queotas, rate limiting
